This article presents the formal verification, using the Coq proof
assistant, of a memory model for low-level imperative languages such
as C and compiler intermediate languages.  Beyond giving semantics
to pointer-based programs, this model supports reasoning over
transformations of such programs.  We show how the properties of the
memory model are used to prove semantic preservation for three passes
of the Compcert verified compiler.}

This article describes the development and formal verification (proof
of semantic preservation) of a compiler back-end from Cminor (a simple
imperative intermediate language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the
Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving
its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.  (Much extended and revised version of \cite{Leroy-compcert-06}.)}
